# TrainScheduler
This web app lets a user input a train and using the current first train scheduled, frequency, and current time, the app will calculate when the soonest scheduled train will arrive.

# What I Used
- HTML, (some) CSS, Bootstrap, and Google Fonts for pretty
- jQuery for logic 
- Moment.js to calculate the time
- Firebase to host inputs
